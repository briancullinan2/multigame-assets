Fingers' notes          : I started this map a long time ago, but never had
                          time to finish it until now... I just started playing
                          with it again a couple of weeks ago, collaborating
                          with my old friend Zdim, and it took on a life of 
                          its own. Influenced by the chaotic and irregular 
                          architecture of old Boston, it's quite different 
                          from anything I've ever done before and may not 
                          appeal to all the gamers out there... But it had 
                          to be done, so here it is.

                          I promise my next level will be smaller :)

Zdim's notes            : Hi. It's me. The Central Scrutinizer. I experienced
                          an outfreakage of extraordinary magnitude while
                          collaborating with Fingers on this level-that-should-
                          not-be. I've seen Them. They're here. Run away.
                          As fast as you can.
