Description             : Tick, tock. Tick, Tock. Clocks, clocks,
			: and more clocks. This map uses custom
			: textures and sounds to get the feel
			: of an almost nightmarish surreal
			: dreamland of lego-brick style buildings
			: and enormous clocks. Imagine the colors
			: of an old photograph being portrayed
			: in a classic mechanical/industrial feel.
			: The textures are metallic with an old
			: mechanical feel, and the sounds are
			: hellish and true to the theme of "clocks".
			: All the clocks work and keep time of how
			: long you have been in game.
