                       I will not help you with your mod, I will not make a map for you,
                       and I am not an all-in-one information service.

   Previous Releases : Lun3DM2 - Let's Drink Beer and Shoot Things, Q3DM
                       Lun3DM1 - Coriolis Storm, Q3DM

        Installation : To install, simply unzip and place lun3dm3.pk3 in your baseq3 
                       directory wherever you installed Quake3:Arena.  The map should now 
                       be accessible via the Multiplayer menu or by typing "\map lun3dm3" at 
                       the console without the quotes.
                     : To play in CPMA (www.promode.org) (highly reccomended) install Lun3DM3 
                       as usual, and additionally, unzip and place lun3dm3-cpm.pk3 in your CPMA 
                       directory.  The map should now be accessible via the CPMA menus or by 
                       typing "\map lun3dm3-cpm" at the console without the quotes.
                     : To play with the custom bots I included, you need to download Harlequin's
                       Team-Storm skin pack from www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/qbranch
                       and properly install it.  The custom bots included are specifically
                       written to a) bring out the good qualities in this map's gameplay, to try
                       and make up for the fact that the bots can't figure out the lift or the 
                       rocket launcher, and b) provide you with all Doom-skinned bots to
                       enhance the atmosphere.  Oh stop whining, they're good skins anyway.
    Acknowledgements : In a very particular order understood only by me -
                       id - especially whoever it was that added the LoD stitching
                       the beta testers - for obvious contribution
                       the QMap.org and #terrafusion ogres
                       Harlequin - for all that skinning and then some 
                       Douglas Adams - for the title and the books it came from
                       than - for some of the texture content I incorporated (the switch mainly)
                       Friction - for giving me the idea for a "flagrant bitching and cussing 
                         clause" (see below)
                       the Q3World level editing forum moderators - for putting up with my 
                         occasional smartassedness
                       anybody who played and liked Lun3DM1 and 2
        Beta Testers : Alcatraz and his Inmates, than, Bal, and Friction in VanillaQ3A, and
                         Fribbles and xfoo in CPMA

- Play Information -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         Player Base : Can be played quite well with either 3 to 5 people in a FFA (maybe six if 
                       you're into that kind of thing) or a 1-on-1 duel.
        Default Bots : Flynn, Mace, Bryson, McCormick (custom)
           Item Load : 2 SGs, RL, PG, LG, GL, YA, RA, MH.  No powerups, no railgun.

- CPMA Version Notes ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      A Full List of : RA and YA reduced to YA and GA
 Differences Between   Slime pool in main room shallowed - you can wade in it and don't have 
    the Q3A and CPMA     to jump to get out
            Versions   No shells on either side of the MH, and fewer cells overall
                       RL moved from one side of the bridge to the other - now in the elbow 
                         of the stairs with a convenient barrel for double-jumping
                       Teleporter in the bridge room moved from the upper level to the lower
                       Hallway between bridge room and curvy-stairs-room widened a bit
                       Various spawns moved or removed, various ammo boxes shifted and swapped
                       Slopy trim and very tops of ramps still clipped to prevent sudden unwanted
                         launches into the air - if you intend to slope jump, you'll have to do
                         it a bit earlier than usual
                       4 5+ healths in the bottom S-Hall
                       50+ healths reduced to 25+ healths
                       More intense gameplay
                       Bots still brick-stupid

- Construction ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Base : New level from scratch
         Inspiration : The layout was inspired by Dapak (www.planetquake.com/dapak), and the
                       looks were inspired by DooM and by the fact that I had a bunch of neat 
                       textures left over from that Doom-Q3 thingie than and I messed about 
                       with back when we didn't know any better.
                     : Yes, there are barrels of slime, but no, they don't explode.  Sorry. :(
      Texture Scheme : LunMetal (olive) (if you plan to use these textures ... a tan version 
                       would look pretty keen, too)
 Very Important Note : This map is not meant to look like Doom.  It is meant to look INSPIRED by
                       Doom. ;p  There was no copying, resizing, sharpening, or duplication.  The
                       rounded StarGrn* shapes are quite obviously the same - that's the entire 
                       point - but every surface was crafted from scratch with only an eye on the 
                       originals.
        Prefabs Used : None
             Brushes : 2850
    Average R_Speeds : 5000 world, w/ entities, no players
 Worst Case R_Speeds : 8500 world, w/ entities, no players
      Editor(s) used : QERadiant 202 and 200f, Adobe Photoshop 5.5
        Known Issues : For all their incredible ability, the Quake3 bots still have trouble with
 (AKA: what the bots   the lift in the main room.  I managed to trick them into pushing the  
    can't do on THIS   button, but once the lift is up sometimes they aren't exactly compelled  
                map)   to get off the damn thing.  And if they do get off, sometimes they jump  
                       back down and stand next to the button. 
                     : They also have a rather unique approach to obtaining the Rocket Launcher.  
                       Instead of jumping across the slime and back, they SWIM it (yeah, that's 
                       right) - especially Bryson.  They do, rarely, jump across or back, but I 
                       have never seen them do both in the same go.  I cannot fathom why, nor  
                       can I fix this.  Just laugh and enjoy the fact that at least you're  
                       getting SOME entertainment from them. :D
                     : Yes, I tried botroams and doNotEnter brushes and all that tricky crap. 

                       I HEREIN RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BITCH AND CUSS AT YOU WITH FLAGRANTLY 
                       SARCASTIC TONES OF VOICE IF YOU E-MAIL ME SUGGESTING ANYTHING TO FIX THE 
                       BOTS' BEHAVIOR, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY READ THIS WARNING.  You  
                       aren't smarter than I am - get used to it.

                     : Reviewers that take off huge amounts of score because of poor bot
                       performance can go jump into some green slime.  I'm really sorry and all  
                       but I didn't program the bots so it isn't my fault.

   |    "You mean we're stuck here on this ship?" exclaimed Ford, suddenly losing       |
   | patience with the whole charade.  "When are you meant to be reaching this planet   |
   | you're meant to be colonizing?"                                                    |
   |    "Oh, we're nearly there I think," said the Captain, "any second now.  It's      |
   | probably time I was getting out of this bath in fact.  Oh, I don't know though,    |
   | why stop just when I'm enjoying it?"                                               |

   |    "What are you talking about?" asked Ford sharply.                               |
   |    "Well," said the Captain, picking his way through the words carefully, "I think |
   | as far as I can remember we were programmed to crash on it."                       |
   |    "Crash?" shouted Ford and Arthur.                                               |
   |    "Er, yes," said the Captain, "yes, it's all part of the plan, I think.  There   |
   | was a terribly good reason for it which I can't quite remember at the moment.  It  |
   | was something to do with ... er ..."                                               |
