* Instructions *

1. Unzip the files in the Baseq3 folder. All files will be placed in
   their respective directories automatically.	
 
2. Go to the "baseq3\scripts" folder and open a file called 
   "Shaderlist.txt".

3. Add this line at the bottom of the text: "jajdarkland1". 
   Save and close it.

4. Once in the Q3radiant editor, go to the texture menu and select 
   "jajdarkland1".
   When applying the skybox texture select the one called 
   "jajdarkland1_skybox".

5. Remember that the texture you'll see is the right side of the 
   skybox.
   As a guide, the right side of the skybox corresponds with the right
   side of the top view in the editor, and the back side corresponds 
   with the upper side of this view.
