TITLE: Skybox 4-Pack # 1
AUTHOR: Isla Kamamee
E-MAIL: islakamamee@yahoomail.com
CREDITS: No one but my computer for toiling away for days rendering these. (They were rendered at the 
highest settings :o)

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: If you dont know how to use skyboxes, you shouldnt download these packs.

DESCRIPTION: I guess this came from a sudden urge to make something the community could use to lighten
their workload a little.  This is a compilation of skyboxes, in 1024x1024.  Each of the skyboxes here
are rendered at the said resolution, not resized.  Some are better quality than others.  I do not take 
credit for these, you can all have
them, but no one can claim them for his or her own, they are for the community as a whole, meaning that
you may use them, but you do not have to cite me in your readme or anything.
I might do another pack, depending on how long this one takes compared how much people use them.(Probably not that much :P)
I cannot do everything however, as you will put these in your own textures folder, probably
rename them, and I cannot write a shader that you will not need to modify, so I included
the templates, one with a sun shader and one without.  well, this is a 4 pack, and I dont have
time right now to do any more so Im going to release as-is.
