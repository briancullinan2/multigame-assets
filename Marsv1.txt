===================================================
System Requirements: Medium to high system specs 
needed to run this map at full speed. Reasonably 
high R speeds combined with heavy use of glass my 
result in heavy FPS hit.

===================================================							  
Description : 
Castle - This level started by another mapper that 
goes by the name Goose who is now working on Unreal 
Championship as a full time level designer. He 
couldn't find time to complete the level himself 
because of his new job and decided to post on the 
quake 3 world forums asking if some one else would 
complete the map in his place. I stepped up and 
took on the job and the level you see before you 
now is the end result.
The level is very cool in its own right mainly 
because two very different level designers worked 
together.

Goose - My final Q3 map. Its a abbandon mars 
outpost. With a little outdoor area. Went for 
clean simple but strong looking I have included a 
few .map files of the map in various stages. 
Maybe some people can learn a few tricks along 
the way. 

I guess this is my way of giving back to the 
community that gave me so much.
