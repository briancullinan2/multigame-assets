Q2DM1 is an all time classic.  There are many remakes for many games, 
but I felt that the world could do with just one more :)

NODM10 is a straight remake.  Scale, the eternal enemy of the remake, is
optimised for smaller CPM matches: 1v1, 2v2 is likely to be ideal.  That
said, I've played at least one fun 4v4 tdm on it.  A quick word on the
'chaingun corner':  You'll notice that I've added a chain mesh.  I really
didn't want to do this, but without it there is a really simple way to 
trickjump out of that dead end without having to come around the corner.
This was a critical point of the map in Q2 and to lose that dead end trap
altogether was not acceptable.  I tried many different options, and this
was the best that I (or anyone I asked) could come up with.

NOCA1 is an altered version, optimised for clan arena (hiding places removed)
but also with a high octane FFA item loadout (including a Quad).  Good
for a blast!
