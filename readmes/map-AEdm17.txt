                          make camping more difficult, changes in pads and
                          layout...

Thanks to               : id Software for providing the source to q3dm17.
                          To www.evilbings.de's Blade who inspired me to
                          do this map with instagib in mind.
                          Thanx also to my other testers: Flash and the
                          folks on the EvilBing instagib server.
                          
Background              : The map was build in about a week with some more
                          days of fine tuning and tweaking. Since I have 
                          played q3dm17 a lot, I wanted to change a few
                          things to make the new map fresh and challenging.

* Design changes *

As mentioned, I started off with id's q3dm17 and moved several things 
around to make the map more instagib conform, e.g. making it very hard 
to camp in this map.

- The pad (that went east) to the old railgun platform was removed. 
  This pad was added to the north and south, where the wall was broken
  open. You can now reach to 4th floor via these pads.

- The lowest level (1st floor) was made symmetrical and a bit narrower.
  Major change: The quint-pad in the middle was replaced with a 2-sided
  teleporter and one pad above the teleporter.

- The 2nd and 3rd floors now have the western parts (north and south) 
  mirrored to the east side as well. Adding 2 more jumppads in the east 
  that go north/south.

- The 4th floor (where the quad used to be along with the teleporter)
  was turned into a larger 8-sided platform that now supports the quad 
  and the railgun.


* More Thoughts *

If you compare my changes to the original q3dm17 you will notice that
the map gets very fast passed, since the central quint-pad on the lowest
floor was replaced with a teleporter. Adding more respawn points makes the
map very unsafe for campers, since 'fresh' players will respawn all around
you. Against 7 hardcore bots in instagib, your average time alive will go
down to an average of 2-5 seconds... this is pure frenzy ;).

The map is ideal for 4-5 players, the maximum (same as with q3dm17) is
definitely 8 players. I tried 11 bots and this made any gameplay 
impossible, too many re-spawn kills.

Does this make the re-make better than id's original... nope :)... but
I hope that the map is interesting enough to try out 8-)).
