Info:

This is the final of my first attempt at a CTF map for Quake III Arena.
The map requires Quake III Arena point release 1.32 (available free from the Internet) to run.
The map refuses to run on lower versions of Quake III Arena (kicking you to your desktop when the map should load).

To run the map, extract dmlctf01.pk3 into your quake3/baseq3 folder (where you installed Quake III Arena).
Load up Quake 3 and look for the map in the CTF section of the Skirmish menu.
Alternatively, you can type /map dmlctf01 in the console to run the map.
