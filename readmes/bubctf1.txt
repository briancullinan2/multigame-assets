info

THIS HAS NO REFERENCE TO THE MOVIE. :)

A CTF arena set between worlds. In a "Vast" expanse where time does not exist. It is not seen through the world of mortals... ahh whatever.

A space map to replace that damn q3ctf4. That was my goal. I am amazed at the fact I
got this map running as well as I did. I knew what I wanted, and from the start I was
worried it wouldn't work due to its size. Luckily with a good amount of beta testing and 
a great texture set to make it look like it does, I think I fairly succeeded in my idea.

This will not work on point releases below 1.25(?) I believe. This is due to the key       values to allow different gametypes and mods.

Comments?

thanx to ...

Kat-for helping me with those stupid bots. :)
7zark7-and all his beta test crew in the Q3W TA forums! You guys rock!
Cardigan-for his tutorial on bot optimization in space maps. I think I'll never
do that again. :)
kabal-for the skybox, everyone seems to love it dude! You get all the credit!
Evil Lair-for making the perfect texture set to fit this map. It really allowed
me to keep it looking very detailed, while using few brushes. You rock too!
ASWP for the initial beta test. What would I do without you.
Threewave- for a great mod and the use if their textures and logos.

And to all of the hundreds of people (wow! hundreds!) who downloaded the betas
and rung it through the ringers to get it going. I never had so may e-mails on one subject!
