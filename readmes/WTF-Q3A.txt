-- MAP INFO & TIPS --
---------------------

This MapPack includes 48 different CTF maps, There are 2 flags per team, 1 weapon per map.

The concept of WTF-Q3A is quite simple. By default, everybody starts with full ammo, and only
1 weapon. By doing so, the WTF-Q3A looks like a MOD, but it's really conventional maps, humm!
The focus is on gameplay through raw skill, not weapon manipulation.

There are two opposite rooms. When you get in the enemy room you can either catch the
enemy flag, pick up a tech or kill the enemies. Most common choice is to catch the flags
and come back to your base to cap. If you don't want the enemy to cap your flag, you can
take both flags, but consider that it takes more time to do so. For those who like to
play defensive, they will certainly enjoy this map.

If you and your team player both have a flag but your team player gets killed.  You have
two choices to return your team flag to the base. (1)Touch the flag on the floor. (2)Capture
your own flag and the one on the floor will return to the base.

If you catch both enemy flags, you don't get double points, but you advise the enemy that
he can't cap his flags.

If you capture both enemy flags, and if when you return in your base one of your team flags
is still there, the fact that you capped the enemy flag, they will reapper in the enemy base
and then the enemy can now cap his flag.

It can happen that 3 players of the same team can have each a flag: 2 players have each
an enemy flag. One of the players looses his flag and the enemy returns his team flag. Then
2 flags reappear in the enemy base while two other players of your team are there. They
both catch a flag, plus your team player outside that still has his flag. Possibility of
lot of points for your team. Also when one player has a flag and another player of
the same team capture an enemy flag that will bring back 2 flags in the enemy base.

As you can see there are many interesting strategies that can be used in WTF-Q3A.

If you pick up an AMMO item, you will become automatically FULL AMMO. To avoid easy
control on powerup item, they are set with random time. An interesting thing in WTF-Q3A-06
everyone plays with an BFG an every time you respawn you have 200% heart & 200% armor.

Another thing very interesting, is that 4 SpaceMaps using the Railgun were included.

Our priorities where gameplay and mapspeed rather then detailed look. After ours of
testing and making lots of map changes we think we reached our goals.

You can use WTF-Q3A maps as a complement in a regular CTF match, like overtime Rocket
Arena in Quake II. A regular match of 8 flags could be followed by a WTF-Q3A map with
a limit of 15 flags. For the Deathmatch or CTF, the WTF-Q3A are ideal for LanParty.

-- MAKING MOD --
----------------

New in version 3 to facilitate the job for people who are making mods compatible to WTF-Q3A.

- In the worldspawn I had ( "WTF" , "weapons number" )
1 - Gauntlet
2 - MachinGun
3 - Shotgun
4 - Grenade Lancher
5 - Rocket Lancher
6 - Lithing Gun
7 - Railgun
8 - Plasma
9 - BFG

- In the .arena file, I add ( "TYPE" , "ffa tourney team ctf cctf oneflag overload harvester wtf" ),
as you can see, the WTF was added. It allows to activate WTF within your mod and then only WTF maps
will be available/see.

- I also add the tag for all flags for the entities ( "classname" , "team_CTF_redflag" ), this one :
("flg" , "1 or 2"), as you can see, I added FLG 1 and 2 for red flags, which allows to identify each
flags. Same was done for the blue flags. Mod coders will be able to display all flags in the HUG,
and/or modify the score structure as we will know of many flags are captured.

- New bots support Grapple/Hook "grapplereach" for all map.
