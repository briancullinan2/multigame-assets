Some words             : My dad and a couple of guys at his work play space ctf a lot, and wanted a new map. I finally gave in, and created this
			 map. Didn't take long to make, but I had soooo many problems with compiling it. I won't get into it...anyway, hope you enjoy
			 this map. Playing with one hardcore bot on your team, against 5-6 other harcore bots on the other team is a lot of fun, really
		         the ONLY way to play. This map makes a good change from the other space maps out there, which are very few. I used some textures 
			 from the Dreamcast map-pack to make the Q3 version of this map, hopefully that's alright. Enjoy.

Installation           : Extract the contents of this zip file to x:\your_quake3_path\baseq3\

		         in the console, and throw in some bots to start fraggin' and kickin' butt and stuff.
						 
                         
Thanx to               : My Dad (Zeppo), all the other guys at his work that helped beta test this map, HrO, excel`, Q3ME, and
			 ID Software for the game, and Raster Productions for the Dreamcast map-pack. My bad if I forgot you...
