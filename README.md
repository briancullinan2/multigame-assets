# multigame-assets
Mostly stolen assets from other games in a separate repo so if it gets reported my code is still safe. I'll probably abandon this account again out of fear over copyrights.
I have no personal creativity because I have no soul.

Download main.zip and rename to main.pk3
https://github.com/briancullinan2/multigame-assets/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

Put in a folder with xxx-multigame.pk3 like baseq3 or it's own multigame or drop it into other mod folders and see what happens.
