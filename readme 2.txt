Description:      A big sized tourney map for Team Arena and a single player version for EntityPlus.
		  Based on the famous Id map q3dm17.

============================================================
Play information

Tourney:          1v1
Deathmatch:       optimal with 3 player
Team deathmatch:  yes
CTF:              no
Bot File (aas):   yes
new sounds:       yes
new graphics:     yes
new music:        no

How to play:      First, you have to obtain Team Arena (missionpack) and an EntityPlus mod 1.1.4 or higher
		  (EntiyPlus download form here: https://github.com/TheEnginesOfCreation/EntityPlus/releases/tag/1.1.6)

		  Then copy the pk3 file in your baseq3 folder (yes, the baseq3 folder)
		  Run Quake 3, and load Team Arena.
		  Select "Play" -> "StartServer" -> choose a gametype -> select "Shipyard 17 by Martinus" -> check out the options -> add bot(s) /TheSwat and Fritzkrieg are important/ -> StartServer

		  OR

		  In Team Arena open the console /~ button/ and type the following commands:
		  /map q3sy17ta
		  type /addbot <botname> <skill>		(You can add bots by hitting esc ingame, and select the "Add bot" menu)

		  If you have EntityPlus mod in your Quake 3 folder, then run Quake 3 (1.32c patch recommended) go to "Mods" and select EntityPlus
		  Select "New game" and choose "Shipyard 17 Boss Battle edition by Martinus" and start the game (also you can play via loaded the map by console using /map q3sy17ep)

		  I recommend you, to increase /com_hunkmegs 128 or 256 or higher to play and enable /r_smp 1 and using 64-bit ioquake3 or the edawn mod client (1.32e) to get better performance.

Info

The maps are playing around a shipyard and a small sized cargo ship with a lot of concrete, metal and water.
I also hide some games and movies references as easter eggs. Find them all! :)

Talking about the fog:
Sorry, but that is necessary to increase performance, and that's why I didn't need to bulid the whole shipyard and both of the sides of the water.

Why Team Arena:
Just because of the "new" weapons and holdables.

Why EntityPlus:
Because the interesting idea of boss battles coming in waves. I thought it will be a good idea.
