Description:	A medium sized map (4-6 players).  Set in a graveyard with crypts and a
		mausoleum all containing the names of my Quake brethren at the Burial
		Grounds server:   http://www.burial-grounds.com

		Unfortunately this map is very taxing on video cards and will require
		Above minimum requirements for smooth gameplay.  Recommended requirements:
		PII 400 MHz, 128 MB RAM, 16 MB video card

		All grass is cushioned (tip from Lloyd M)
		Quad damage is hidden (jump down in the lava pit and over to the QD room)
		Mega-health is hidden (shoot 20 20's tomb)
		Secret teleporter (go behind my tomb and step on button)
		Fountains of youth (stand in fountains to gain health)

Thanks to:	My Quake brutha Taz_FL.  Without his creative abilities this map would
		not be what you see here.  Thanks Bud!
