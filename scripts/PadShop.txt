PadShop is a pad-map for the fantastic 'PC gamer' magazin.
This was really a honor and a great felling for me and my work that I get this big 
offer to made a special map for a magazin how PC gamer.
Big, big, big, Thanks !!!
What is PadShop..?
PadShop is a great pc games shop and in this you are not bigger as an gashopper.
You will find many food for your eyes how new models, new textures, nice jokes and some 
secrets (in this map are four other rooms, two of this are secret rooms..gg).
Than you hear nice soundfiles and new music, special for this map (for this you need 
the extra music file).
PadShop is a really big map, a hardware killer how my other maps PadGarden and PadKitchen.
You need a verry good hardware to play this pad-map with high details, sorry.

Okay, time to rock...!!!

I hope you like it...!!??
