I dont know if its the right skin. The blueprints were for a BMW 3series Sedan,
but FearMe's skin looks like a M3. So i dont really know what it should be called
in the end. Whatever, its modelled, and it looks nice :-)

Modelled by Dawid 'Dave' Kulesz
Skinned by FearMe
Model time	: dont know, never looked at the watch. approx 2-5 hours.
Triangles 	: 692
Skin Res  	: 512x512
Blueprints	: Yes, front, rear, side. I think they were from Tom Suurland (www.suurland.com)

		  Primarly it was planned for Urban Terror (www.urbanterror.com)

Thats it. I hope you like it. Spread it. But be fair. Dont distribute it under your name or
anything like that. Thanks.
